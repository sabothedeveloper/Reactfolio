Crafted to showcase my enthusiasm for web development and the uplifting journey I embarked on in 2020 ðŸš€.

## Background

I embarked on my coding adventure right as the pandemic began, finding a passion that was both challenging and rewarding. Over the years, I've honed my skills, working with diverse technologies and platforms. This portfolio is not only a reflection of my past works but also an embodiment of my love for continuous learning and innovation.

From mastering the intricacies of **React** to delving into the world of web3, my journey has been anything but ordinary. My portfolio showcases the projects I'm most proud of, the challenges I've overcome, and the skills I've acquired along the way.
